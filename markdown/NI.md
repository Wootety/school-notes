# Chapter 1 - Overview

## Transmission Media & Network Cables

- Twisted Pair
- Optical Fibre
- Coaxial Cable

## Structured Cabling

Installation of cables in building / campus in structured manner

- **Demarcation Point**
  - Point where telecom prover network ends and connects with on-premise wiring at customer premise
- **Equipment Room**
  - Large Telecom room that may hourse servers, routers, switch, etc.
- **Telecommunications Room* 
  - House Equipment and wiring consolidation points that serve users inside building
- **Backbone / Vertical / Riser Wiring**
  - Connects between telecommunication rooms, as rooms are nomally on different floors
- **Horizontal Wiring**
  - Connects telecommunications rooms (may use wiring closets) to individual outlets / work areas, through wireways / conduits / ceiling spaces
- **Work Area Components**
  - Connect end-user equipment to outlets of horizontal cabling systems

### Demarcation Point

- Point which outdoor cabling interfaces with intrabuilding backbone cabling
- Boundary between service provider and responsibility of customer

### Equipment Room (ER)

- After cable enters through Demarcation point, it travels to equipment room (ER)
- Centre of voice and data network
- Effectively a large Telco room that may house servers, routers, switches, etc.
- Equipment room is different from Telco room as ER is building / campus serving vs floor serving

### Telecommunications Room (TR)

- ER feeds to one or more TRs
- TRs are where backbone cabling transitions to horizontal cabling

### Backbone / Vertical Cabling

- Any cabling between ER and another TR throughout the facility
  - Includes TRs on same floor
  - Vertical Connection(risers) between TRs on different floors
  - Inter-buildings cabling in a multibuilding campus
- Usually Fibre Optic cables

### Distribution / Horizontal Cabling

- Distributes cables from TR to work areas
  - Usually UTP cables
  - Protects against pairs that might fail during installation

### Work Area

- Area serviced by individual TR
- usually occupies 1 floor / part of 1 floor of building

#### Servicing Work Area

- Uniform wiring plan must be used through patch panel system
